INSTALLATION

This is a header-only library, which does not requires any special installation.

(In fact, I am too lazy to make it).

Just put the header files generator.hpp and _generator.hpp somwehere, where you C++ compiler can find them, and that's it.

If you wish, you may regernerate _generator.hpp, using the provided python script. However, I don't believe that it is ever needed.
